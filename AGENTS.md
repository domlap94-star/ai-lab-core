# AI-Lab repository rules

## Scope and architecture

- Treat `AI_LAB_MASTER_PLAN.txt` as the architectural source of truth and
  `CODEX_MASTER_EXECUTION.md` as the executable delivery plan.
- Work in one small, reviewable, testable chunk at a time. Update the execution
  plan after every completed chunk.
- Supported Flutter targets are Windows, Android, and Web. Do not restore iOS
  or macOS support.
- Preserve the public/private boundary: public gateway `127.0.0.1:8789` may
  expose Web/API/updates but never `/control`; private gateway
  `127.0.0.1:8788` may proxy `/control` to supervisor `127.0.0.1:8787`.

## Safety

- DEPLOYED BINARIES ARE API CONSUMERS. A source-code update does not mean that
  every API consumer has been updated. Before changing an existing response
  contract, account for current source, the latest stable Windows and Android
  builds, live Web, and integrations/imports. Do not break an existing public
  API response shape without a versioned/additive endpoint, compatibility
  layer, or an explicit release/migration strategy. Remove a legacy endpoint
  only when the minimum supported app version guarantees that no supported
  client still needs it.
- Never mutate production CRM data, merge/delete clients, run uncertain
  backfills, publish a release, change signing/secrets, or change network
  exposure without explicit human approval.
- Data cleanup must proceed through audit, read-only projection, dry-run,
  old-to-new report, conflict detection, approval, apply, and post-apply audit.
- Preserve provenance, source evidence, audit trails, and backward
  compatibility where reasonable.
- Use Alembic for schema changes. Destructive migrations require approval.
- Never commit `.env`, secrets, Android keys, keystores, release binaries,
  runtime data, generated reports, or backups.

## Tooling and verification

- Windows shell is PowerShell 5.1. Backend Python runs in Docker; do not assume
  a working host Python.
- Flutter SDK: `C:\FlutterSDK-New\flutter`.
- Do not run `flutter clean`.
- Read and write repository text as UTF-8 without BOM when practical.
- After every chunk run relevant backend tests, API auth tests, Flutter
  `analyze`/`test` when applicable, `git diff --check`, and `git status --short`.
- Never use `git add .`; stage explicit paths only.
- Do not commit a chunk whose acceptance criteria or required tests fail.
